# Interview Task

Welcome to our coding challenge! This task is designed to assess your skills with React and Typescript. Please read the instructions carefully and reach out if you have any questions.

## Task Overview

You are tasked with creating a navigation menu with three buttons within the app. Please work on the problems to the best of your abilities and do not worry if you are unable to complete all points. 

### 1. Setup and Repository Cloning:

- First, clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Create your branch using the format `yourname-feature`.
- Install all the necessary dependencies to run the project.

```bash
npm install
# and
npm run dev
```

- Run the development server.

### 2. Create a Navigation Menu:

Add a navigation component to the main layout of the app. This component should include three buttons.

### 3. Custom Button Variant:

In the theme configuration of Chakra UI (usually found in `styles/theme.ts` or similar), create a custom button variant. The design specifics are up to you, but it should be visually distinct from the default styles. Make sure one of the buttons in the navigation menu uses this custom variant.

### 4. Button with Dropdown:

One of the buttons should have a dropdown menu associated with it. This dropdown can have a few simple list items. Design the dropdown in a way that complements the overall design of the navigation menu.

### 5. Button with State:

Another button should have a counter displayed next to it. This counter should start at 0, and every time the button is clicked, the counter should increase by 1. Use the `useState` hook from React to achieve this functionality.

### 6. Button for Navigation:

Yet another button should re-route users to another page within the app when clicked. You can choose any existing page or create a new one for this purpose.

### 7. Image Inclusion:

Somewhere in the navigation menu or any component of your choice, incorporate an image. It can be any image, even a placeholder, but please consider its placement, size, and relevance to the task or theme.

### 8. Styling and Design:

Feel free to use any styling or design choices that you think will enhance the user experience and visual appeal of the navigation menu and overall application. Your design choices will also be factored into the assessment.

### 9. Submission:

Once you've completed the above tasks, commit and push your changes to your own branch, then create a pull request against the main branch of this repository. Please add a comment as part of your pull request with your Name, email, desired compensation. Provide a small paragraph describing your design choices and why you think you would be a good fit. Any general feedback on the assignment and/or interview process is greatly appreciated aswell.

## Resources and Assistance:

You are free to use any resources you want to complete this challenge. If you need assistance with git commands, we have provided a `gitcheatsheet.md` file in the repository to help you out. Reffering to the [Chakra UI documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started) will also be of great help to you.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- **Code Structure**: Is your code modular, organized, and easy to follow?
- **React & TypeScript Proficiency**: Proper use of hooks, props, and TypeScript features.
- **Chakra UI Styling**: Ability to create and apply styles using Chakra UI, especially with the custom button variant.
- **Design Choices**: Aesthetics, user experience, and the thought process behind your design choices.
- **Attention to Detail**: Adherence to the provided instructions and overall UI/UX considerations.
- **Problem Solving**: How you approached challenges and the solutions you implemented.

We appreciate the time and effort you put into this task. All the best!
